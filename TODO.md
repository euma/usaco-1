# TODO List

## Training

### Chapter 1

- namenum: reverse mapping to reduce the complexity.
- pprime: the code is a little long and duplicated.
- transform: too many codes to solve it.
- clock: there is another faster matrix solution.
- checker: use bitwise operation to make it faster.

### Chapter 2

- frac1: there is better way to compare fractions
- sort3: math method with min/max comparison
- money: more simple solution is required
