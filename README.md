# USACO Problem Solutions

## About

The United States of America Computing Olympiad (USACO) is a computer
programming competition aimed primarily at secondary school students 
in the United States. Participants of the USACO submit programs in one
of four languages, C, C++, Java, and Pascal, to various competitions
held throughout the year. (from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_of_America_Computing_Olympiad))

## Training

The USACO contains several training pages on its website which are
designed to develop one's skills in programming solutions to difficult
and varied algorithmic problems at one's own pace. In addition to around
100 problems, there are texts on programming techniques such as greedy
algorithms, dynamic programming, shortest path, and many others. Enthusiasts
find the training pages so useful that people from other countries use
them to prepare for their own national Olympiads; those from other countries
in fact outnumber U.S. participants. (from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_of_America_Computing_Olympiad#Training_pages));
